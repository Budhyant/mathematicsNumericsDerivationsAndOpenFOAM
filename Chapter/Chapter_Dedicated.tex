\textit{
    \textbf{T}his book is edidcated to the \OF community and to all colleagues
    and people who are interested in computational fluid dynamics, numerical
    simulations and who support Tobias' work he shares on his website Holzmann
    CFD. Tobias' ambition to write the book was based on his personal love to
    the open-source thought. Thus, his goal and wish are to give any CFD lover
    an introduction to computational fluid dynamics while showing interesting
    equations and exciting relations that are not obviously presented in most
    of the famous books and papers in that particular area. Additionally, the
    book should prepare everybody for the tasks that one may work on during
    your personal career, hopefully with \OF. Tobias wishes everybody all the
    best and exciting time with \OF and the beautilful subject named CFD.
